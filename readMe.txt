-Rapper Contact Manager Generator-

The Rapper Contact Manager Generator is a 
Java GUI created in order to help producers 
and studio owners stay in contact with rappers
who they want to call in for features in rap songs.

How to use it:

1) Open RapArtistContactManagerGenerator.jar
2) Click the add rapper button to add a new rapper
3) Click the remove rapper to add a selected rapper
4)Click the open in browser button to view the xml doc in the browser


How it works:
Basically I am using java libraries in order to read and modify
the rapartists.xml file. I manipulate that data through a java
applet swing GUI. The xml file is then formatted to be viewed in
alphabetical order by rapper name by the use of an XLST style sheet
along with some bootstrap. I also allow the capability for images to be
shown in this xml doc, producers can paste an image URL of a rapper for 
the contact manager when theyâ€™re adding a new artist
