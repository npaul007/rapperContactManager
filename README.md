# rapperContactManager
A contact manager built for producers, artists and record company managers who need to contact other rap artists.

How to use it:

1. Open RapArtistContactManagerGenerator.jar
2. Click the add rapper button to add a new rapper
3. Click the remove rapper to add a selected rapper
4. Click the open in browser button to view the xml doc in the browser


How it works:
I am using java xml parsing libraries in order to read and modify
the rapartists.xml file. I then manipulate that data through a java
swing GUI. The xml file is then formatted to be viewed in
alphabetical order by rapper name through the use of an XLST style sheet
along with some bootstrap to make it look pretty. I also allow the capability for images to be
shown in this xml doc, users can paste an image URL of a rapper for 
the contact manager when theyâ€™re adding a new artist to the registry
